## Overview

Aiming to centralize retail data management across multiple nations, this project includes modules for data extraction, cleaning, and database interaction, with a particular focus on efficient data handling and management.

## Technologies Used

This project employs a diverse range of technologies, ensuring robustness and efficiency in data management:

- **Python:** Primary programming language for script development.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Tabula:** Extracts tables from PDFs into DataFrame objects.
- **Requests:** HTTP library for API interactions.
- **Boto3:** AWS SDK for Python, used with Amazon S3.
- **SQLAlchemy:** SQL toolkit and ORM library.
- **YAML:** For configuration and data serialization.
- **PostgreSQL:** Database system for structured data storage.
- **Docker:** Utilized for containerizing the PostgreSQL database, enhancing portability and consistency across different environments.

## Features

### Data Extraction:

- **Databases:** Utilizes SQLAlchemy and custom connectors to interface with RDS databases. Capable of executing SQL queries and retrieving structured data efficiently.
- **PDFs:** Leverages the Tabula library to extract tables from PDF documents directly into DataFrame objects.
- **APIs:** Uses the Requests library for interacting with web APIs, fetching data in JSON format.
- **Amazon S3 Buckets:** Uses Boto3, the AWS SDK for Python, for interacting with Amazon S3, handling data types like CSV and JSON.

### Data Cleaning:

- Utilities to clean and transform the extracted data for consistency. This includes handling missing values, standardizing formats, and removing duplicates.

### Database Integration:

- Tools for uploading cleaned data into a centralized database system, ensuring data integrity and efficient storage.
